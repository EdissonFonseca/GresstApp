## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (Recommended version: 18 or higher)
- **NPM** or **Yarn**
- **Ionic CLI**:  
  ```bash
  npm install -g @ionic/cli
  ```

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user/gresstapp.git
cd gresstapp
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration Files Setup

After cloning the repository, you need to set up your configuration files:

1. **Environment Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp src/environments/environment.example.ts src/environments/environment.ts
   ```
   Then edit `src/environments/environment.ts` and add your Google Maps API key:
   ```typescript
   export const environment = {
     production: false,
     GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: 'your-api-key-here'
   };
   ```

Note: The environment configuration file is gitignored and should not be committed to the repository. Each developer needs to set up their own configuration file. The Google Maps API key configured here will be used by both the web application and the native mobile app.

### Mobile Development

Synchronize Capacitor with native platforms:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

Open the project in the appropriate IDE:

Android:
```bash
npx cap open android
```

iOS:
```bash
npx cap open ios
```
